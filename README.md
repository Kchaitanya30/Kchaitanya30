## About
I am a graduate student in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, with a research focus on Earth observation, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis. My work centers on using satellite imagery, spatial data, and reproducible workflows to study environmental and socio-environmental processes. I am particularly interested in applying computational methods to analyze large geospatial datasets and support research in environmental monitoring.
